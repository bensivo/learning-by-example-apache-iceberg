# learning-by-example-apache-iceberg

"Learning by example" is a series where we learn the basics of a technology with a simple example project.
This series is both for my own personal learning (I often learn a lot by putting these projects together), and as an instructional aide for anyone learning these technologies.

This LBE is all about Apache Iceberg, the foundations of today's Open Data Lakehouse ecosystem. 

## How to use this repo
This project is divided into modules, each one building on the last. Each segment includes a "README", giving some background and discussion on that topic,
plus an example implementation of the topic discussed. 

To follow along, open the modules in order and read the README in each one.
